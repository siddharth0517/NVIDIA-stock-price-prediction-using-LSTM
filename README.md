# NVIDIA Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project predicts NVIDIA's stock price using a **Long Short-Term Memory** (LSTM) model. It involves **data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment** using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Stock Data Collection**: Uses `yfinance` to fetch historical NVIDIA stock data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations for outlier detection, moving averages, and feature correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization using `MinMaxScaler` and sequence creation for LSTM.
- **LSTM Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses RMSE and visualization for accuracy assessment.
- **Future Price Prediction**: Predicts the next day's stock price.
- **Deployment**: Implemented using Streamlit for an interactive web app.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Pandas & NumPy
- yFinance
- Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/siddharth0517/nvda-stock-prediction.git
   cd nvda-stock-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- The web app allows users to visualize historical stock data and predicted prices.
- The model provides a forecast for the next dayâ€™s NVIDIA stock price.

## Results

- The model's performance is evaluated using RMSE.
- The RMSE score achieved by the model is **5.84**.
- A comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices is plotted.

## Future Improvements

- Enhancing model accuracy with more features (e.g., news sentiment, macroeconomic indicators).
- Implementing hyperparameter tuning.
- Extending the model to predict prices for multiple stocks.
